# 🌿 Prototype: Leaf Simulation with Spell Interaction

This prototype, built using **Unity ECS**, set up an interaction where leaves respond dynamically to a casted spell.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Entity-based leaves**: Each leaf is represented as an ECS entity.  
- **Animated Curves**: Leaves are animated without physics, driven by curves inside an `ISystem`.  
- **Spell mechanics**:  
  - A growing **AOE** expands around the player.  
  - An invisible **orb** moves forward, influencing the leaves’ animation.
