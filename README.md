Prototype : Leaf simulation interaction with spell

Using Unity ECS, this prototype aims to create a simulation of animated leaves by a casted spell.
Each leaf is an entity, animated via Animated Curves (no physic) in an ISystem.
The spell creates a growing aoe around the player, then move an invisible orb in front of him.
